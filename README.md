📌 Project Overview                                                                                                                

The Keystroke Logging Demonstration project provides hands-on exposure to system-level keyboard input monitoring at the operating system level. This project is developed strictly for educational and defensive cybersecurity purposes, enabling learners to understand keystroke-based attack techniques and how such threats can be detected and prevented in real-world environments.

The application captures keyboard input events in real time, demonstrating how keystroke logging operates while emphasizing ethical use and cybersecurity awareness.
