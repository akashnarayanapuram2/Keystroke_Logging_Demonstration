Keystroke Logging Demonstration
Project Overview

The Keystroke Logging Demonstration project provides hands-on exposure to capturing keyboard input events at the operating system level. This project is developed strictly for educational and defensive cybersecurity purposes, enabling learners to understand keystroke-based attack techniques so they can be effectively detected and prevented in real-world environments.

The application captures keyboard input events in real time, helping users understand how keystroke monitoring works and the potential cybersecurity risks associated with such techniques when misused.

Captured Events

The system records the following keyboard events:

Key Press

Key Hold

Key Release

All captured events are stored in:

JSON format for structured data analysis

Text format for easy human-readable interpretation

A Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) is included to control execution ethically and responsibly.

Key Features
